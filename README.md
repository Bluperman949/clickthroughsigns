# Click Through Signs
Click Through Signs is a Minecraft mod for Fabric and NeoForge 1.20.5.  

This mod allows you to open a chest (or any other block with a GUI) by clicking on a wall sign or item frame in front of it.  
Crouching allows you to edit the sign/rotate the framed item. Empty item frames will not open menus.
