# Click Through Signs
Click Through Signs is a Minecraft mod for Fabric and NeoForge 1.20.5.  

This mod allows you to open chests (and any other block with a GUI) by clicking on a wall sign in front of it.  
Crouching allows you to edit the sign.  

I plan to add the same functionality for Item Frames in the future.
